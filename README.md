# Description of favorite functions and what not

- My personal favorite is the event loop that creates all the divs and css for the game and handles all the game logic.
- The other function that I found really cool is checkForWin(), that finds the winner. Checks for the winner and returns a boolean value and higlights the 3 boxes in a row.
